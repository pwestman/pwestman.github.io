**Approved Proposal**
=====================

*Proposal for the development of* [Smart Hive](pwestman.github.io)

Prepared by Roberto Loja, Yurii Sentsiv, Paul Westman  
*Computer Engineering Technology Students*

January 20, 2017

 

### **Executive Summary**

As students in the Computer Engineering Technology program, We will be
integrating the knowledge and skills we have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. The internet connected hardware will include a custom
PCB with sensors and actuators for tracking and recording the movement of bees
in and out of the hive. The database will store the population of bees inside
the hive as well as temperature and humidity readings. The mobile device
functionality will include requesting the most recent readings of population of
bees in the hive, temperature and humidity and will be further detailed in the
mobile application proposal. We will be collaborating with the following
company/department: Humber Honey Bees.

### **Background**

The problem solved by the project is finding a non-invasive way of tracking bee
populations in the hive with varying temperature and humidity. With the depleted
population of Honey bees recently, accurate data in this area is crucial. Up to
date data can be requested and viewed from a mobile application that will be
developed and integrated with the hardware component over the next two
semesters.

The Humber Honey Bees are an initiative undertaken by Humber in June 2015 in an
attempt to rebuild the local population of Honey bees in the area around Humber
College. Honey bees are an essential part of our world as they are responsible
for pollinating many of the plants that we eat. Due to their declining
populations, studying and tracking them has never been more important.
Therefore, this project will attempt to compile crucial data on Honey bee
movement and population in the hive in varying temperatures and humidity.

We have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content” and have found and read articles that provide technical
background information:

The first article provides insight into a smart bee hive that measures
population, honey production, and temperature/humidity. [@5753235]

The next article introduces the use of strain gauges and instrumentation
amplifiers. [@5767428]

The last article demonstrates a method for estimating the population of a bee
hive by measuring the hive’s capacitance. [@7419791]

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable us to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as our capstone project.

### **Methodology**

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall and winter semesters. Our coursework
will focus on the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
Phase 1 Hardware build.  
Phase 2 System integration.  
Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build was completed in the fall term. It fit within the CENG
Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that was allowed to be used was 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which
+/- 15V or as high as 45 VDC. Maximum power consumption was to be no more than
20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the winter term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that we have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase.

### **Concluding remarks**

This proposal presents a plan for providing an IoT solution for bee tracking at
Humber College. This is an opportunity to integrate the knowledge and skills
developed in our program to create a collaborative IoT capstone project
demonstrating our ability to learn how to support projects. We request approval
of this project.
