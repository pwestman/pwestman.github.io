		<p>I have been discussing with another professor, Jeremy Brooks, about an oportunity to talk with the owner of <a href="http://terrebleu.ca/beekeeping-history">TERREBLEU</a>, a farm that keeps bees to potentially test out our finished prototype sometime next spring. We will hopefully be coordinating a time in the upcoming weeks where myself and other team members, Roberto Loja and Yurii Sentsiv, can have a phone call to discuss the possibility of this in the new year.</p>

		<p><b>Power Up Milestone</b></p>
		<p>This week I will be showing a demo of my powered up PCB. The PCB is connected to the GPIO header on my Raspberry Pi. It has an LED light, a temperature sensor, and a light sensor. </p>

	 <H3>Week 6</H3>
	 <p>So far I am on track with the activities for the project versus the schedule. I have completed the soldering of the components onto the PCB and I am ready to test to see if the connections are vaild. The current mechanical assembly milestone is complete and ready for the power up milestone next week. Some problems that I encountered was acquiring parts that would not take months to be shipped from overseas or that would not be an additional $50 for shipping to get here sooner. To solve this problem I have found that DigiKey will ship overnight and does not cost a fortune to send. The parts that I will still need to acquire are the IR obstacle avoidance sensor and the IR thermometer for inside the hive. The digital scale was ordered and has arrived. It cost a total of $22.99 plus tax, which came in right at our budget of $25. Financially, the project is on track as almost all components have been acquired and I am still under my projected budget.</p>
	 
	 <p>This is a picture of the completely soldered PCB. The PCB has yet to be tested and might need some touch ups on the soldering job.</p>

	 <p>This week we purchased most fo the materials for our project. I have uploaded my Individual Progress report below as well as some of the receipts for hardware components that we have ordered. Some of the problems that were encountered this week were the time it takes to ship and receive the components that we are looking for. Many of the items wouldn't arrive until the end of October/ mid way through November. I have tried to look in North America but the challenge is that these items are much more expensive, which makes it difficult to stick to our budget.</p>
